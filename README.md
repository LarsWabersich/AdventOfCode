# :christmas_tree:Advent Of Code 2022:christmas_tree:

Initially I thought I could use this opportunity and learn some Rust by completing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), but for now I'm sticking to Python (which I'm also not very fluid in...)

 Whenever I get some sparetime, I might revisit some of these challenges and try to solve them with Rust. 

Will Post my Solutions whenever they're done, but never on the same day :) 

Keep on Coding and Happy Holidays! ``
